I am in my second year of Master's in Geography at the Deparment of Geography and Spatial Sciences with a focus on geo-spatial analyses. I am interested in urbanization, urban GIS and wildlife. I am currently working on a research to quantitatively and qualitatively compared globally gridded GDP datasets and trying to figure out uncertainties among the datasets. 
</p>I really liked the course objective and I want to hone my skills in python and data intensive methods that I can possibly use it in my research in the near future. I believe this course will help me gain valauble insights on the different kinds of reserach in Urban Science and the ways to appraoch them. Along with that, I think this course will help me develop some much needed skills required in a professional setting to succeed in the industry. </p>
